NASA Picture of the Day
=======================

A small static web page that fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and lets users search by date, save searches to localStorage, and view past searches.

Files
- `index.html` — the page markup (form, result container, search history)
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — fetch logic, localStorage history, and rendering
